# VenomRansomware
This Python project simulates ransomware behavior by encrypting files and directories, changing the desktop background, and displaying a countdown timer with warnings. It collects payment info via a Discord webhook, modifies the Windows registry for persistence, and schedules tasks for reboot execution.
